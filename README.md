## About the game:
The world consists of a large sea which has several enemies, rocks and barrels present. The boat
has a sail and a cannon that shoots fireballs. Floating barrels would be present with gifts that
give different amounts of points on top of them which can be collected by jumping over the
barrels. The boat has health points. On killing sea monsters, gifts drop. 
The sea monsters can damage the boat and reduce health points. The game ends when we lose all 
your health points. There would be rocks present in the sea and if we hit them, 
we will lose health points. At random times, a strong wind would start blowing in any particular 
direction.The boat changes its speed according to the direction of the wind.
